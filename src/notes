We have an already existing app which takes in a GH personal access token and then
a username and retrieves a list of repositories for that user. Your task is to create a
directive that we can use on other pages of this site in the future anytime we want to
 show a repository. This directive should use Bootstrap's "panels" with a header and body.
 Use your new directive in the existing template instead of the current ul/li structure.
 Just to be clear: there should be NO list at all.



 1. DONE clone repo
 2. make a directive that shows the repository
 3. use Bootstraps panels (w/ a header an body)
 4. use the new directive to replace the current ul/li.
    Just to be clear: there should be NO list at all.

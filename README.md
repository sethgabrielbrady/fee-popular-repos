# GitHub Repos

A small app to display github repos for practice at The Iron Yard.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, then run an http server in the `src/` directory. Be sure to type in GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to authenticate with GitHub.


## About
This page requires a valid github id to use and can access information about github users
based on their username. It uses directives to populate bootstrap panels with data
pulled from the API.

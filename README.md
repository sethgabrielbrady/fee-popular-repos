# GitHub Repos

A small app to display github repos for practice at The Iron Yard.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, then run an http server in the `src/` directory. Be sure to type in GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to authenticate with GitHub.


## About
This page requires a valid github id token to use and can access information about github users by username. It uses custom directives and filters to populate bootstrap panels with, sort through, and manipulate the data pulled from the API.

## TO DO
- [ ] The Popularity info doesn't display the correct number.
